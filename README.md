# AVR-programming
ATMEGA16 and ATMEGA2560 programming on Spark V and FireBird V robots by nex robotics using embedded C.

main.c file in every folder contains the main code of that project.
lcd.c file contains the lcd interfacing and fucntions used for debugging.
main.c and lcd.c files should be placed in the same folder while compiling.

1) white-line-follower:
White line follower built on SPARK V robot based on ATMEGA16 microcontroller.

2) black-line-node
Black line follower and solid node detection and action robot built on FireBird V robot based on ATMEGA2560 microcontroller.

3) dijkstra:
Shortest path finding and traversing in a hexagonal grid robot built on FireBird V robot based on ATMEGA2560 microcontroller.
